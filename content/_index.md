        I am a statistician in the UCSF Department of Anesthesia. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD in biostatistics from UC Berkeley, where I worked on integrating causal inference and efficient non-/semi-parametric estimation for time-to-event clinical trials. I was lucky to enjoy diverse scientific collaborations with Novo Nordisk, the University of Copenhagen, and other members of the Joint Initiative for Causal Inference.
        
        My research interests lie primarily in unifying causal inference and estimation using machine learning under the umbrella of developing efficient and robust, assumption-lean inferential techniques tailored for the applied sciences. Broadly speaking, I am often motivated by methodological philosophy of targeted loss-based estimation approach to non- and semi-parametric inference (i.e. assumption-lean or model-agnostic perspective). While my applied science interests are diverse, I have recently been working on cardiovascular outcome trials. I am also deeply interested in developing open-source software to promote reproducibility, transparency, and data analysis ‚Äúhygiene‚Äù in applied statistics and statistical data science.

          - Causal Inference 
          - Targeted Machine Learning
