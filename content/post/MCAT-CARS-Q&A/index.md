## Creds/Intro
I've scored in the $98^{th} - 100^{th}$ percentile 3 times on actual test ('10, '14, '19), been a long-time r/MCAT & discord contributor, and taught MCAT for ~6 years back in the 2010s. This follows up my post on CARS passages; here I'm laying out my approach to CARS questions and answers. As before I'll try to explain my reasoning and much of what I'll say will echo common advice, but please exercise judgment - if you try something I advise but it doesn't work for you, try something else! Here goes.

## Fundamentals
* **READ QUESTIONS CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY.**  
Do not skim the question; do not rush ahead to the answer choices. Do not collect 200 dollars. The CARS section is an epistemic nightmare in which truth does not exist - the passage is your holy book, the author your almighty deity. If you don't understand what the question is asking, YOU DO NOT HAVE A METRIC FOR JUDGING ANSWER CHOICES. Your default CARS order of operations should be  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1\. Read, process, and honest-to-god understand the question.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2\. Figure out some criteria the correct answer must meet.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3\. Start looking through the answer choices for the closest/best match.  

* **READ ANSWER CHOICES CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY**  
The meaning of answer choices can hinge on a single word (just like in questions). Questions and answers aren't like the passages - passages are excerpts curated by the AAMC, but ultimately passages are some rando's words, **while questions and answers are entirely written by the AAMC**. This means that for the questions and answer choices, THE AAMC HAS DECIDED THAT THESE EXACT WORDS IN THIS EXACT ORDER ARE BOTH NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT FOR CHOOSING THEIR ANSWER CHOICE. On the MCAT you get points for matching the AAMC answer key and the easiest way to do this in CARS, in my opinion, is to set aside your sense of self and try to think like the AAMC test writers. Read the questions and answers carefully and completely, and interpret them as literally and directly as you can.

## Strategies
* **Referencing the passage**
  * Pros:
    1. Referencing the exact passage text improves accuracy - AAMC CARS answer explanations usually quote passage text when they justify right and wrong answers, so I reiterate: to pick the same answers they pick, judge and explain answers the same way they do.
    2. Less memory/processing burden when reading passages - if I know I'll be referring back to the passage, I only need to remember where details are instead of trying to remember the passage details in their entirety. e.g. "this paragraph is about manifest destiny" or "that sentence gives examples of contemporary counter-arguments against the idea of manifest destiny"
    3. Repeated readings improves recollection and understanding - some passages are straightforward and you'll understand them perfectly at first glance. For more convoluted ones, the extra passes (ie you referencing the text while trying to answer questions) with the context of the full passage in your mind could improve or even correct bad first interpretations.  
  * Cons:
    1. Referencing the passage takes too long
       * If your test date is in a week or two, then trying to learn a new CARS strategy is probably not going to turn out well. Doing CARS is a skill that involves a specific passage-reading mindset and a particularly nitpicky approach to questions and answers. As with any skill, it may then require some practice before becoming useful. I've found doing CARS this way to be efficient but I realize others might not.  
       * Speed without accuracy gets you nothing, so I think it makes sense to first establish a highly accurate method and then work on getting the best result possible in the limited time. Guessing based on general passage tone or main idea might work to some extent but A) it requires a more taxing reading strategy, B) is unreliable (high variance), C) isn't a improvable skill (ie guessing strategy doesn't improve with practice), and D) is less accurate than answering based on passage evidence.  
    &nbsp;
    
* **The answer choice ranking system** \- *ie. how to not waste time hesitating between answers.*  
I used to waste a ton of time comparison shopping between answer choices and this is my solution to that problem. It still takes time to decide what rank an answer choice should get, but in this process my decision-making is more efficiently structured. The ranking system is:  
    1. Definitely correct. You're sure you understand the question and answer choice, and you can point to the exact parts of the passage that prove this choice is the correct one.
    2. Probably correct. You're confident you understand the question and answer choice, and you can gesture toward the part(s) of the passage that support this choice.
    3. Neutral. Maybe you didn't read the answer choice or didn't understand it. In any case, you don't have any evidence either for or against it.  
    4. Probably incorrect. You're confident you understand the question and answer choice, and you can gesture toward the part(s) of the passage that weaken this choice.  
    5. Definitely incorrect. You're sure you understand the question and answer choice, and you can point to the exact parts of the passage that prove this choice is wrong.  
    &nbsp;  

    It's not crucial, but try to go through the answer choices from easiest to understand to hardest (e.g. start with the shortest, simplest looking answer choice). Read and process that first answer choice. Rank it. If it's not a 1, move on to the next answer choice. At most 3 iterations later you'll be ready to pick the highest ranked answer choice. (If 2 are tied, refer to the **Deciding 50/50s** bullet below. If more are tied, randomly select among the highest ranked, mark the question, and then come back to it if you have time at the end of the section)
    
* **Deciding 50/50s**  
Chances are you've gotten to the 50/50 by trying to figure out what's the best answer choice; now that you're stuck, try changing perspectives - figure out which answer choice is more wrong (and then pick the other one). e.g. Which answer has (more / more concrete) passage evidence against it? Which answer requires more assumptions to be true?

* **Generic Wrong Answer Types**. Making up a CARS question and the correct answer to it is easy; making up 3 reasonable-sounding but ultimately incorrect answer choices is a pain in the ass (I've tried). This is why a lot of CARS wrong answers follow some kind of recipe, eg.
  1. ***Distorted passage excerpts.*** Perhaps the easiest way to create a tempting wrong answer choice is to just slightly tweak a good answer. Don't take the bait - if you saw somebody throw a turd in the punch bowl, you wouldn't drink any right? If there's even a single word in the answer choice that is definitely wrong - IT'S. \*\*\*\*\ing. WRONG. (this is what used to trip me up the most) Some common tricks are:
      - jumping across can-is-ought distinctions, e.g. [We ***can do*** well on CARS] vs [We ***will do*** well on CARS] vs [We ***should do*** well on CARS]. These are 3 different claims about [possibility] vs [reality] vs [judgement]. Don't mix them.
      - manipulated strength of claims, usually toward an extreme - this is where "no extreme answers" comes from. e.g. Author says ***some*** priests are pedos; trap answer choice says ***many*** priests are pedos.
      - switcheroos, e.g.
        * In the passage [person A] says something, but in the answer [person B] says it
        * In the passage [A] has [properties] but the answer says [B] has [properties]
        * In the passage [A] has [properties] but the answer says [A] has [opposite properties]  
  2. ***Irrelevant passage quote or paraphrase***  
  Another easy way to make a wrong answer? Take an important sentence from the passage that doesn't actually address the question - chances are some poor sap will pick it just out of familiarity. Don't be that guy.
  3. ***Common-sense or popular opinion, but unsupported by the passage.***  
  'Nuff said.
  4. ***Answer to a different (and perhaps very similar) question.***  
  Remember what I said about reading questions carefully and completely? Maybe the question asks ``what would the author most disagree with", and you read it as "what would the author most agree with." etc.  
* **Doing Questions Out of Order**  
 Most of the time I think doing questions out of order will just waste time and distract you, but if the first question is 100% about finding passage info (e.g. "For which of the following does the author provide the most evidence?") then I might skip that question to do the others first. This is because I'll refer back to the passage in the process of answering the other questions (which will naturally improve my passage familiarity), and the improved passage familiarity will help me to find evidence faster.

## Special Question/Answer Types
 * **2 part answers of structure: [True/False, Strengthen/Weaken, Reasoning/Evidence, etc.]**  
 Answer the easier half first. If you can figure out the first bit easily, do that first and that should cut your answer choices down to a 50/50. If you think the latter bit will be easier, start there. This way, if you need to guess quickly to save time, you're left with the best chance of guessing correctly.
 * **Strengthen/Weaken**  
 Often the claim to be strengthened/weakened can be found in the passage, ***with supporting evidence or explanation in the surrounding sentences***. If you just go back to the passage and look for the supporting sentences in the passages, the correct answer might just be a parallel/anti-parallel paraphrase of that passage info. Easy money
 * **Is vs. Best/Worst/Least/Most**  
 Sometimes questions ask you for the answer choice that ***does something***, and sometimes they ask you for the answer choice that ***most does something***. These questions should be approached differently:
    - if the question asks "Which of the answer choices supports the author's claim that...", then you're good to stop as soon as you see an answer choice that definitely supports the author's claim.
    - on the other hand, if the question asks you to compare the answer choices, (e.g. Which answer choice BEST supports the author's claim that...), then you have to look at all the answer choices. Even if you think answer choice A) is a 1. on the answer correctness scale, you still gotta read all the answer choices and compare.
 * **Roman Numerals**  
 Check to see if some roman numerals are more important than others, e.g. if all the answer choices include I., then just ignore it. If you can rule out 3 answer choice by figuring out of II. is true or not, then start with that trying to figure out if II is true or not and see if you can get lucky and shortcut things.
 * **Assume/Imply/Infer**
    - An assumption is something that has to be true for the author's argument to be valid. e.g. For the argument "You should study for the MCAT" to be valid, we need "You want to do well on the MCAT", and "Studying will improve your MCAT score".
    - An implication (for CARS purposes) is something that has to be true, ***assuming*** the author's argument is valid. e.g. if the argument "You should study for the MCAT" is valid, then it implies that you're planning to take the MCAT.
    - An inference is something that is likely true, assuming the author's argument is valid. e.g. if the argument "You should study for the MCAT" is valid, then you're probably a big ole neeerrrrrd (jk you're a champ for reading this long-ass post)
