## Letter 1 - On saving time

> Hold every hour in your grasp. Lay hold of today's task, and you will not need to depend so much upon tomorrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. Nothing is ours, except time.

> We were entrusted by nature with this single thing, time - so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession. Keep what is really yours, and you cannot begin too early. For it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the cask. Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the quality is vile.

## Letter 2 - On discursiveness in reading

> The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.

> When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner.

Depth over breadth?

> Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well. From the many things which I have read, I claim some one part for myself; I am wont to cross over even into the enemy's camp, - not as a deserter, but as a scout.

> Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second, to have what is enough.

Not much is necessary; we decide what is enough

## Letter 3 - On true and false friendship

> If you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship means.

> Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship,; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself; share with a friend at least all your worries and reflections. Regard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal. Some, fearing to be deceived, have taught men to deceive; by their suspicions they have given their friend the right to do wrong.

> Love of bustle is not industry, - it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind. And true repose does not consist in condemning all motion as merely vexation, slackness and inertia. Men should combine thise tendencies, and he who reposes should act and he who acts should take repose.

## Letter 4 - On the terrors of death

> Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart from life contentedly: no good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss. Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die. 

> Since the day you were born you are being led thither toward death. We must ponder this thought if we desire to be calm as we await that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.

> Do you know what limits the law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst and cold. It is not necessary for you to pay court, to submit to the stern frown or to humiliation; nor is it necessary for you to scour the seas or to go campaigning. That which is enough is ready to our hands.

What room is left for goals & aspirations?

## Letter 5 - On the philosopher's mean

> The first thing which philosophy undertakes to give is fellow-feeling with all men; in other words, sympathy and sociability. We part company with our promise if we are unlike other men. Philosophy calls for plain living, but not for penance. Let men find us different only by looking closely. If they visit us at home, they should admire us, rather than our household appointments.

> Cease to hope, and you will cease to fear. Just as the same chain fastens the prisoner and the soldier who guards him, so hope and fear keep step together. Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past.

## Letter 7 - On crowds

> Do you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? I say, crowds; for as yet I cannot trust myself to them with safety - there is no person who does not make some vice attractive to us, or stamp it upon us, or taint us unconsciously therewith. What then do you think the effect will be on character, when the world at large assaults it? You must either imitate or loathe the world, but both courses are to be avoided; you should not copy the bad simply because they are many, nor should you hate the many because they are unlike you. Associate with those who will make a better man of you, and welcome those whom you yourself can improve; the process is mutual.

> In the morning they throw men to the lions and the bears; at noon, they throw them to the crowd. The spectators demand the outcome of every fight is death, and the means are fire and sword. "But he was a highway robber; he killed a man!" And what of it? Granted that he deserved this punishment - what crime have you committed, poor fellow, that you should deserve to see this show?

> I write this not for the many, but for you; each of us is audience enough for the other. I am content with few, content with one, content with none at all. Lay these words to heart, that you may scorn the pleasure which comes from the applause of the majority.

On the other hand, mass communication and wide appeal gets shit done. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Letter 8 - On the philosopher's seclusion

> Avoid what pleases the throng: avoid the gifts of Chance! Do you call these things "gifts" of Fortune? They are snares. What Chance has made yours is not really yours; the good that could be given, can be removed. 

## Letter 9 - On philosophy and friendship

> In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I say "can," I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.

## Letter 10 - On living to oneself

> Crates, the disciple of Stilbo, noticed a young man walking by himself, and asked him what he was doing all alone.  
"I am communing with myself," replied the youth.  
"Pray be careful, then, " said Crates, "and take good heed; you are communing with a bad man!"

Crowds are bad, but so is solitude - rock and a hard place much? Make a few good friends I guess.

## Letter 13 - On groundless fears

> This is the touchstone of a true spirit; no prizefighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been beaten black and blue; the only contestant who can confidently enter the lists is the man who has seen his own blood, who has felt his teeth rattle beneath his opponent's fist, who has been tripped and felt the full force of his adversary's charge, who has been downed in body but not in spirit, one who, as often as he falls, rises again with greater defiance than ever.

Separate feelings from post-mortems & planning.

## Letter 14 - On the reasons for withdrawing from the world

> We should conduct ourselves not as if we ought to live for the body, but as if we could not live without it. We should cherish the body with the greatest care; but we should also be prepared, when reason, self-respect, and duty demand the sacrifice, to deliver it even to the flames.

Unrelated note: Seneca says to avoid hatred, jealousy, and scorn; but isn't it good to have the animosity of shitty people? And re: looking down on other people "Down is where some people are"... I guess we should separate emotion (disgust/contempt/etc) from moral judgment? Big ask.

## Letter 15 - On brawn and brains

Eh... I call bullshit on devaluing physicality. Why would you get to keep your mind but not your body in "the afterlife"?

## Letter 17 - On Philosophy and Riches

> If you wish to have leisure for your mind, either be a poor man, or resemble a poor man.

I'm fine with living modestly, but what about providing for loved ones? I should be ambivalent to their suffering? It's fine to earn in excess so long as you don't hoard benefits for yourself?

## Letter 18 - On festivals and feasting

> It shows much more courage to remain dry and sober when the mob is drunk and vomiting; but it shows greater self-control to refuse to withdraw oneself and to do what the crowd does, but in a different way, - thus neither making oneself conspicuous nor becoming one of the crowd.

Don't isolate; don't capitulate. Coexist. Recall Letter 5. Also

> Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest of fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: "is this the condition that I feared?" There is no reason, however, why you should think that you are doing anything great; for you will merely be doing what many thousands of slaves and many thousands of poor men are doing every day.

## Letter 20 - On practicing what you preach

> This, I say, is the highest duty and the highest proof of wisdom, - that deed and word should be in accord, that a man should be equal to himself under all conditions, and always the same.  
"But," you reply, "who can maintain this standard?"  
Very few, to be sure; but there are some. It is indeed a hard undertaking, and I do not say that the philosopher can always keep the same pace. But he can always travel the same path.

What about "when in Rome?" Expression may differ as long as values aren't compromised?

## Letter 21 - On the renown which my writings will bring you

> Your greatest difficulty is with yourself; for you are your own stumbling-block. You do not know what you want. You are better at approving the right course than at following it out. You see where true happiness lies, but you have not the courage to attain it.

Recall Letter 1, procrastinator. Also

> There is the same difference between these two lives as there is between mere brightness and real light; the latter has a definite source within itself, the other borrows its radiance; the one is called forth by an illumination coming from the outside, and anyone who stands between the source and the object immediately turns the latter into a dense shadow; but the other has a glow that comes from within. It is your own studies that will make you shine and will render you eminent

## Letter 22 - On the futility of half-way measures

> You are perhaps expecting such words as these: "It is base to flinch under a burden; no man is brave and earnest if he avoids danger, if his spirit does not grow with the very difficulty of his task." Words like these will indeed be spoken to you, if only your perserverence shall have an object that is worth while, if only you will not have to do or suffer anything unworthy of a good man. From business it is easy to escape, if only you will despise the rewards of business.

Don't fetishize hard work, or efficiency, or productivity. Goals matter. Outcomes matter. Also

> Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long. 

## Letter 23 - On the true joy which comes from philosophy

Pompous title much? But still...

> Therefore I pray you, do the one thing that can render you really happy: cast aside and trample under foot all the things that glitter outwardly and are held out to you by another or as obtainable from a nother, look toward the true good, and rejoice only in that which comes from your own store, from your very self, that which is the best part of you.

## Letter 24 - On despising death

> Why, indeed, is it necessary to summon trouble, - which must be endured soon enough when it has once arrived, or to anticipate trouble and ruin the present through fear of the future? It is indeed foolish to be unhappy now because you may be unhappy at some future time. All past time is lost time; the very day which we are now spending is shared between ourselves and death. It is not the last drop that empties the water-clock, but all that which previously has flowed out

## Letter 25 - On reformation

> It is, indeed, nobler by far to live as you would live under the eyes of some good man, but nevertheless I am content if you only act, in whatever you do, as you would act if anyone at all were looking on; because solitude prompts us to all kinds of evil.

## Letter 26 - On old age and death

> Put aside the opinion of the world; it is always wavering and always takes both sides. Death will deliver the final judgement. What you have done in the past will be manifest only a the time when you draw your last breath. I accept the terms; I do not shrink from the decision.

Live knowing that you will die; live so you can die well.

## Letter 27 - On the good which abides

> No man is able to borrow or buy a sound mind

Surely we can heed advice and benefit from others' experiences? Maybe we need to have enough experiences of our own to be able to distinguish between good & bad?

## Letter 28 - On travel as a cure for discontent

> Are you surprised, as if it were a novelty, that after such long travel and so many changes of scene you have not been able to shake off the gloom and heaviness of your mind? You need a change of soul rather than a change of climate; your faults will follow you whithersoever you travel.

ie. don't travel to escape your problems? At the same time

> I disagree with those who, welcoming a stormy existence, wrestle daily in hardihood of soul with life's problems. The wise man will endure all that, but will not choose it; he will prefer to be at peace rather than at war.

I guess contradiction is ok - static rules for dynamic lives seems silly; take a trip, refresh the soul and if that doesn't work, introspect.

## Letter 29 - On the critical condition of Marcellinus

Don't invest in lost causes (but how can you know for sure unless you try?) Also

> I have never wished to cater to the crowd; for what I know, they do not approve, and what they approve, I do not know. It takes trickery to win popular approval; the favour of ignoble men can be won only by ignoble means.

What's wrong with ignoble means? Ideological purity tests rub me the wrong way... but I guess this holds true for consequentialism also. What's the right balance to strike? 

## Letter 30 - On conquering the conqueror

> Always think on death in order that you may never fear it

Embrace inevitable death, that we might not squander our time; not to seek death, but to die gracefully without letting the fear of death make decisions for us.

## Letter 31 - On siren songs

> "But," you say, "is not trifling and superfluous work, and work that has been inspired by ignoble casues, a bad sort of work?" No, no more than that which is expended upon noble endeavours, since the very quality that endures toil and rouses itself to hard and uphill effort, is of the spirit, which says: "Why do you grow slack? It is not the part of a man to fear sweat."

... Agree to disagree? There's merit to both, but surely the latter is better?

## Letter 32 - On progress

> Much harm is done even by one who holds you back, especially since life is so short; and we make it shorter still by our unsteadiness, by making life into little bits, and fritter it away. Hasten ahead, remembering continually what a noble thing it is to round out your life before death comes.

## Letter 33 - On the futility of learning maxims

> Give over hoping you can skim, by means of epitomes, the wisdom of distinguished men. Look into their wisdom as a whole; study it as a whole. They are working out a plan.

I'm reminded of Newton's alchemy, Wagner's antisemitism, Kant's & many others' racism. Not that we can't appreciate great works by imperfect people, but being mindful of context can (should?) inform how we interpret their works?

## Letter 38 - On quiet conversation

> Words should be scattered like seed; no matter how small the seed may be, if it has once found favorable ground, it unfolds its strength and from an insignificant thing spreads to its greatest growth.

Cause to choose one's words carefully.

## Letter 42 - On values

> With regard to the objects which we pursue, our stupidity may be clearly proved by the fact that we hold that "buying" refers only to the objects for which we pay cash, and we regard as free gifts the things for which we spend our very selves. We are eager to attain them at the cost of anxiety, of danger, and of lost honour, personal freedom, and time; so true is it that each man regards nothing as cheaper than himself.

## Letter 51 - On Baiae and morals

> Just as, to the wise and upright man, one style of clothing is more suitable than another, without his having an aversion for any particular colour; so there are places also, which the wise man will avoid as foreign to good morals. Just as I do not care to live in a place of torture, neither do I care to live in a cafe.

# Letter 52 - On choosing our teachers

> Suppose that two buildings have been erected, unlike as to their foundations, but equal in height and in grandeur. So with men's dispositions; some are pliable and easy to manage, but others have to be laboriously wrought out by hand, so to speak, and are wholly employed by the making of their own foundations. I should accordingly deem more fortunate the man who has never had any trouble with himself; but the other, I feel, has deserved better of himself, who has won a victory over the meanness of his own nature, and has not gently led himself, but has wrestled his way, to wisdom.

Our paths differ; all walks have their merits if the direction is praiseworthy.

# Letter 56 - On quiet and study

> Beshrew me if I think anything more requisite than silence for a man who secludes himself in order to study! But I have lodgings right over a bathing establishment. So picture to yourself the assortment of sounds, which are strong enough to make me hate my very powers of hearing! Accordingly, I shall change from my present quarters. I merely wished to test myself and to give myself practice. Why need I be tormented any longer, when Ulysses found so simple a cure for his comrades even against the songs of the Sirens?

Why do we seek out unnecessary complications and challenges? Is it foolish? Is the struggle worthwhile in itself?

# Letter 59 - On pleasure and joy

> The wise man is joyful, happy and calm, unshaken. If you are never downcast, if your mind is not harassed by my apprehension, through anticipation of what is to come, if day and night your soul keeps on its even and unswerving course, upright and content with itself, then you have attained to the greatest good that mortals can possess. That which Fortune has not given, she cannot take away.

Guess I'm not wise yet

# Letter 60 - On harmful prayers

> He really lives who is made use of by many; he really lives who makes use of himself. Those men, however, who creep into a hole and grow torpid are no better off in their homes than if they were in their tombs. Right there on the marble lintel of the house of such a man you may inscribe his name, for he has died before he is dead.

# Letter 61 - On meeting death cheerfullly

> I am endeavouring to live every day as if it were a complete life. I do not indeed snatch it up as if it were my last; I do regard it, however, as if it might even be my last. The man who does something under orders is not unhappy; he is unhappy who does something against his will. Let us therefore so set our minds in order that we may desire whatever is demanded of us by circumstances, and above all that we may reflect upon our end without sadness.

Stoic happiness vs activism?

# Letter 62 - On good company

> I do not surrender myself to my affairs, but loan myself to them. When I give myself to my friends. I spend my time in the company of all the best; no matter in what lands they may have lived, or in what age, I let my thoughts fly to them.

We choose how to spend our time and energy. Keeping in good company doesn't just apply to the physical, but also to the mental: Letter 38 - words can take root & grow.

# Letter 63 - On grief for lost friends

> Let not the eyes be dry when we have lost a friend, nor let them overflow. We may weep, but we must not wail, because then we seek the proofs of our bereavement in our tears, and do not give way to sorrow, but merely parade it. "What," you say, "am I to forget my friend?" It is surely a short-lived memory that you vouchsafe to him, if it is to endure only as long as your grief.

> To me, the thought of my dead friends is sweet and appealing. Cease to put a wrong interpretation of the gifts of Fortune. Let us greedily enjoy our friends, because we do not know how long this privelege will be ours.

> If you have buried one whom you loved; look about for someone to love, otherwise we have injured ourselves more than Fortune has injured us; since Fortune has robbed us of one friend, but we have robbed ourselves of every friend whom we have failed to make.

People die - family, friends. Dying is inevitable and indiscriminate; it's foolish not to live accordingly.

# Letter 70 - On the proper time to slip the cable

> The wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can. He will mark in what place, with whom, and how he is to conduct his existence, and what he is about to do. It is not a question of dying earlier or later, but of dying well or ill. There are times, nevertheless, when a man, even though certain death impends and he knows what torture is in store for him, will refrain from lending a hand to his own punishment. It is folly to die through fear of dying. No general statement can be made, therefore, with regard to the question whether, when a power beyond our control threatens us with death, we should anticipate death, or await it.

> Every man ought to make his life acceptable to other besides himself, but his death to himself alone. The best form of death is the one we like.

# Letter 73 - On philosophers and kings

> The foolish greed of mortals makes a distinction between possession and ownership, and believes that it has ownership in nothing in which the general public has a share. But our philosopher considers nothing more truly his own that that which he shares in partnership with all mankind. For these things would not be common property... unless every individual had his own quota.

My possessions can be taken away; what is really mine is that which everyone has... whatever that is. Seneca mentions peace and liberty as "common property"... peace and liberty for whom? There were slaves! Seneca argues in this letter that philosophers are beholden to rulers for providing them the leisure to philosophize, but his words tell me that what I really own is only what the most deprived, least advantaged person owns - something that neither I nor Seneca, in our privileged positions, have any understanding of. What is really mine and is this even an interesting question? 

# Letter 74 - On virtue as a refuge from worldly distractions

> "What," you ask, "will the wise man experience no emotion like disturbance of spirit? Will not his features change colour, his countenance be agitated, and his limbs grow cold?" I admit that this is true; but the sage will retain the firm belief that none of these things is evil. Whatever shall remain to be done virtue can do with courage and readiness.

Instinct, habits, gut reactions - we'll never have total control. We try to do better and forgive ourselves for falling short.

# Letter 75 - On the diseases of the soul

> Let this be the kernel of my idea: let us say what we feel and feel what we say; let speech harmonize with life. That man has fulfilled his promise who is the same person both when you see him and when you hear him.

> We hasten towards virtue while hampered by vices. I am ashamed to say it; but we worship that which is honourable only in so far as we have time to spare.

# Letter 76 - On learning wisdom in old age

> What is more foolish than refusing to learn, simply because one has not been learning for a long time? You should keep learning as long as you are ignorant, - even to the end of your life. "As long as you live, keep learning how to live." 

> This is the error under which we labour - we value no man at what he is, but add to the man himself the trappings in which he is clothed. When you wish to inquire into a man's true worth, and to know what manner of man he is, look at him when he is naked; make him lay aside his inherited estate, his titles, and the other deceptions of fortune. Consider his soul, its quality and its stature, and learn whether its greatness is borrowed, or its own.

# Letter 


# Letter 91 - On the lesson to be drawn from the burning of Lyons

> Strangeness adds to the weight of calamities, and every mortal feels the greater pain as a result of that which also brings surprise. Therefore, nothing ought to be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent forward in advance to meet all problems, and we should consider, not what is wont to happen, but what can happen. We should therefore reflect upon all contingencies, and shold fortify our minds against the evils which may possibly come.

# Letter 92 - On the happy life

> What is the happy life? It is peace of mind, and lasting tranquility.

> If good health, rest, and freedom from pain are not likely to hinder virtue, shall you not seek all these? Of course I shall, but not because they are goods, - I shall seek them because it is a good thing to choose them. Our actions are valuable, but not the actual things we do.

> But is not the wise man happier if he has lived longer and has been distracted by no pain, than one who has always been compelled to grapple with evil fortune? Answer me now, - is he any better or more honorable? If he is not, then he is not happier either

Focus on virtue aside, this reminds me of how happiness is relative and people revert to baseline after happy/lucky events. Can we manipulate the relative happiness frame, or is it fixed outside of our control?
